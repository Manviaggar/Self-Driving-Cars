# Autonomous Driving Simulation

Welcome to the Autonomous Driving Simulation project! This project demonstrates an autonomous vehicle system using JavaScript and custom neural network algorithms. The simulation features a main car that detects and navigates around obstacles on a straight road, with future plans to incorporate more complex road conditions.

## Project Overview

This simulation showcases how an autonomous vehicle can safely navigate through obstacles using real-time decision-making. The neural network, developed from scratch without external libraries, processes sensor data to control the vehicle's movements.

## Features

- **Custom Neural Network**: Coded from scratch to handle decision-making for the vehicle.
- **Obstacle Detection**: The vehicle can detect obstacles ahead and decide whether to move left, right, forward, or backward.
- **Visual Representation**: Interactive visualization of how the neural network nodes make decisions.
- **Future Enhancements**: Plans to introduce road curves and varying conditions to improve navigation.
